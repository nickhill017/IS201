                        <p>I had a lot of fun and exciting oppertunities throughout my Public education that has inspired me to learn and grow.</p>

                        <p>My Elementary education I went to Mountain View Elementary. I don't have quite as many Fond memories, but I do remember my last year, I had the chance to be my Elementary School Mascot as a Mountain Lion. A real big time for me to learn and grow and get out of my shell. That really was the thing that got me out of my major shyness phase. </p>

                        <p> I don't have too much to talk about Junior High Except it was the beginning part of me Loving music. I took band there my 7th grade and couldn't stop. I met so many good friends there and it was all in all great for me.</p>

                        <h4>High School</h4>

                        <p>
                            High School was by far the most influential part of my life. I participated in a couple of school activities, mostly participated in band activities in my school. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>I participated in my High School Musical Pit. that is when we had live music playing for the Musical happening on stage. I had the chance to perform in 2 Musicals through the Pit. We Performed Tarzan and Newsies. <Br>

                                <li> Marching Band: <br>
                                    I spent 5 years of my Life participating in marching band granted 2 of those 5 were in parades which were ok. but the best was hands down something called Field Show. <br> <br>
                                    I played the Sousaphone for Marching band, it was a wearable Tuba for your information and it was so much fun to particpate in. <br> <br>
                                    <img src="../Images/Sousa.jpg" height="500px" alt="me with sousa"> <br> <br>
                                    After that time playing the sousaphone my last year of marching, i acutally didn't march on the field persay. I was someone called the Drum Major of the Band. I was glorified conductor to put it plainly. I was on a stand placed at the edge of a football field and I conducted the band in playing music. <br><br>
                                    I was the leader of the Band and this was super beneficial to me in my life to teach me valuable skills I would endlessly apply in my life

                        <p> I had the Chance to serve in the Alpine German-Speaking Mission, which covered Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. I officially flew out of the country on September 10th, 2019. arriving at the Preston england MTC on the 11th of September. I didn't offically get to Germany until late October of that same year.</p>

                        <p>during my time there I got to learn a brand new language and meet some amazing people who have changed my life. I spent a majority of my time in Germany, having that be about 13 months in toal. but occassionally veering away and living in Austria for about 7 months and then Switzerland for 3 months. I could probably upload a lot of pictures of my mission here but for your sake, and mine, here is one that I enjoy.</p>

                        <p>after getting home from my Mission, I found work relatively quick. A leader I had growing up reached out to me shortly after coming home and offered me a job at a ware house he managed at. The Company's name is Container and Packaging. I worked on the inventory specialist team. This entailed unloading, receiving, and counting the product in the warehouse, where the rest of the warehouse worried about getting orders out of the warehouse. </p>

                        <p>Although stressful, my time here has been super beneficial for me after being here for a year. I look forward to what more fun adventures happen to me the further along my education I go.</p>

                        <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Biggest Life Lesson</h2>
                        <p>During my final year of my High School education, I decided I wanted to participate in my Church Missionary program. Shortly before my graduation, I got approval from my Church to serve a Mission. They assigned me to serve in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, to learn German and to Invite others to come Closer to Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>I was so excited to finally have this amazing experience come into my life. I was supposed to fly out that September of 2019, approximately 4 months after getting this letter from my Church. I would intially fly into Preston, England and there learn what exactly I will be doing and of course learning German, however this would be the most humbling event that I have yet experienced.</p>
                        <p>After being in Preston, England for about 4 of the 6 weeks. I started to notice there was a lot of backlash coming my direction from these newly met acquaintances I met on a plane at the beginning of these 4 weeks. I felt something was off between the group of us. Later at the end of that week, one of the people from this group came up to me and explained how they were bullying me behind my back and calling me names and punishing themselves for my actions with certian topics. From all of this it slowly made more sense why I felt like I was <span class="emp">"hated."</span>  I knew then and I thanked the guy who told me, and from there I learned a valuable lesson that has stuck with me since. Having friends and others to physically support you makes a situation better, but it sure doesn't determine our own happiness in our current situation. Strive to be that person who you can help make situations better, but don't soley rely on that to determine how happy you can be. It will take a lot of tears and an emotional rollercoaster to fully learn and comeout on top, but it will be worth it.</p>
                        <p>Eventually after a lot of my own personal time with this whole situation, I did improve and became someone better and eventually befriended those who wronged me and learned how to work well with them, despite the times where they made me feel like I really had no one who could support me. From this, I learned life won't go your way, and people might hate you, but it is really what you do next that determines what you make of the situation. I have applied that lesson more and more the older I got and especially when I talked with a couple of stubborn German people during my 2 years of my Mission.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Just kidding, if I went to the moon, I feel like people would already know.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>No my biggest achievement that I never thought I would ever accomplish was the race I ran in July of 2022.</p>
                        <p>The race I ran was the Spartan Beast, it is a 22 KM or a 13.3 mile run, and the location is along the ski slopes of Snow Basin, a Ski Resort along the east side of the Rocky Mountains. Along the race there are 15 obstacles that the racers needs to overcome to say at the end that they completed the race.</p>
                        <p>I had a co-work who came up to me earlier that year in March and asked if I would be interested to run The Spartan Beast with him and his friend. Suprisingly I said yes. There the training began and it was difficult to make time for this running training, work, and to top it off school.</p>
                        <p>we had plenty of running experineces before hand especially one trail running experience we went to mount Wire in Salt lake and then later ran along the mountains going back into the canyon out of the valley. it was beautiful to be up there and see the beauty, and well the whole thing was 11 miles roughly and well at that experience I realy didn't feel prepared for the race that would happen about 2 week from that time.</p>
                        <p>Race Day came and I was nervous to see how I would perform. The race started at 10 am and we expected to get done at 3pm. the race went and for the first 3 miles it wasn't terrible and the walls we climbed over was nothing, but then the race truly began and we hit this massive Hill that we needed to hike up. it took us like an hour to maybe hike this 1-2mile incline. but with that it brought us only to almost half way, maybe. I didn't know if I could make it especially after hill. I wanted to really just say, i feel accomplished with what I already have done.</p>
                        <p>Thankfully I had my co-worker and his friend to help motivate me to keep running and keep racing. the race after that point was difficult, but it slowly got better. the obstacles felt like they were easier to get through the running felt great. and well seeing the finish line made the whole race worth it.</p>
                        <p>Never in my life would I, a person who absouletly loathed running, ever think that I would finish a race. It was not just any race, it was a Spartan race.</p> -->
